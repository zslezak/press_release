        <p><em>New York, 5 July 2023</em> - The United Nations, today, is kicking off a communications campaign to rally 
            for the Sustainable Development Goals (<strong>SDGs</strong>), the roadmap for people and planet adopted by 
            world leaders in 2015. Ahead of a critical <strong>UN</strong> Summit in September, the campaign aims to 
            amplify an urgent call for ambitious new action, showcase the Goals as the blueprint for sustainable progress 
            globally, and galvanize the global public around this shared agenda for our common future.</p>
        <p>At halftime toward the deadline of 2030, the promise of the <strong>SDGs</strong> is in peril. For the first 
            time in decades, development progress is reversing under the combined impacts of climate disasters, conflict, 
            economic downturn and lingering COVID-19 effects.</p>
        <p>The 2023 <strong>SDG</strong> Summit will gather world leaders at the United Nations Headquarters in New 
            York on 18-19 September to reaffirm their collective commitments to the Goals and the promise to leave 
            no one behind. This Summit is a defining moment to urgently put the world back on track to achieving 
            the <strong>SDGs</strong>.</p>
        <p>Starting today, in a major digital activation across platforms and countries worldwide, the 
            <strong>UN</strong> campaign aims to re-energize the conversation about the Goals.</p>
        <div class="paragraph">
            <p>&quot;We want to get everyone on board for the <strong>SDGs</strong>&quot;. &quot;Our hope is that 
                decisionmakers and individual citizens alike will feel inspired to join the conversation and 
                contribute to achieving the Goals with new resolve and ambition.&quot;</p>

                Global Communications.</em></p>
        </div>
        <p>Building off the color wheel brand of the <strong>SDGs</strong>, the campaign uses a dynamic new visual 
            system for its messaging to build momentum, raise awareness and mobilize accelerated action for the 
            <strong>SDGs</strong>.</p>
        <p>One core campaign component is the call to individual citizens to take action on the <strong>SDGs</strong> 
            through the <strong>UN</strong>&apos;s ActNow initiative across all 17 Goals. From using public 
            transportation, to fundraising for schools or speaking up for equality, the platform lists steps that 
            everyone can take to accelerate progress on the <strong>SDGs</strong> and create better lives on a 
            healthier planet for all.</p>
        <p>A curated group of high-profile influencers from entertainment, sports and beyond, the Circle of Supporters, 
            will galvanize their social media communities with a combined reach of more than 80 million globally to 
            take individual action on the <strong>SDGs</strong> and to impress upon decisionmakers the urgency to act 
            now.</p>
